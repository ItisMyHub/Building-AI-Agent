# Introduction to Quantum Computing

Basics of qubits and core ideas: superposition, entanglement, and interference.

Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers. Unlike classical bits, which are either a 0 or a 1, a quantum bit, or **qubit**, can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously.

## Key Concepts

1.  **Superposition:** A qubit can be in a combination of 0 and 1 at the same time, allowing quantum computers to explore many possibilities at once.
2.  **Entanglement:** Two or more qubits can become linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, no matter the distance separating them. Measuring one instantly influences the other.
3.  **Interference:** Quantum algorithms use interference to amplify the probability of getting the right answer while canceling out the probability of getting the wrong ones.
