# The Mystery of Dark Matter

Summarizes evidence from gravitational effects and notes leading particle candidates.

Dark matter is a mysterious, non-luminous substance that is believed to constitute approximately 27% of the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, making it impossible to observe directly with telescopes.

Its existence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the rotation speeds of galaxies and the gravitational lensing of light from distant objects. While several candidates have been proposed, such as WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles), the true nature of dark matter remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in modern physics.
