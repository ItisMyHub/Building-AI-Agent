# Mycorrhizal Networks: The Wood Wide Web

Explains fungal-plant symbioses that transfer water/nutrients and bolster forest health.

Mycorrhizal networks are underground hyphal networks created by mycorrhizal fungi that connect individual plants together and transfer water, carbon, nitrogen, and other nutrients and minerals.

These symbiotic relationships are critical for the health of forest ecosystems. The fungi receive carbohydrates from the trees, and in return, they help the trees absorb water and nutrients from the soil. These networks also allow trees to communicate, sending chemical signals to warn neighboring trees of insect attacks or disease.
