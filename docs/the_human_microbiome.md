# The Human Microbiome

Describes microbial roles in digestion, immunity, and mental health (gutâ€“brain axis).

The human microbiome is the collection of all microbes, such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, and their genes, that naturally live on our bodies and inside us. These microbes are not invaders but are essential for human health.

- **Digestion:** Gut bacteria help break down complex carbohydrates that our bodies cannot digest on their own.
- **Immune System:** A healthy microbiome helps to train and regulate the immune system, protecting us from pathogens.
- **Mental Health:** Emerging research suggests a strong link between gut health and mental well-being, often referred to as the "gut-brain axis."
