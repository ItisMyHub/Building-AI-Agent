# AI Ethics and Safety

Highlights concerns around bias, accountability, and privacy (e.g., GDPR) for responsible AI.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents transformative potential, but it also introduces significant ethical challenges. Key areas of concern include algorithmic bias, job displacement, data privacy, and the development of autonomous systems.

- **Bias:** AI models trained on biased historical data can perpetuate and amplify societal inequalities. Ensuring fairness and representation in training data is a critical step.
- **Accountability:** When an AI system makes a mistake, determining who is responsible—the developer, the user, or the owner—is a complex legal and ethical question.
- **Privacy:** AI's ability to analyze vast datasets raises concerns about surveillance and the erosion of personal privacy. Regulations like GDPR aim to provide a framework for data protection.
