# An Introduction to Stoicism

Focuses on virtue and the dichotomy of control: prioritizing judgments/actions over externals.

Stoicism is an ancient Greek school of philosophy founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium. It teaches that virtue, the highest good, is based on knowledge, and that the wise live in harmony with the divine Reason (also identified with Fate and Providence) that governs nature.

A central tenet of Stoicism is the dichotomy of control: recognizing the difference between what we can control and what we cannot. We should focus our energy on our own actions and judgments (what we can control) and accept external events (what we cannot) with tranquility.
