# An Overview of Probabilistic Models

Introduces key probability concepts, applications, and contrasts Bayesian vs. frequentist approaches.

Probabilistic models provide a principled framework for reasoning under uncertainty. They define a space of possible worlds and assign probabilities to events.

## Key Concepts
- Random Variables
- Joint Distributions
- Conditional Independence
- Bayesian Inference

## Applications
Used in natural language processing, robotics, bioinformatics, and decision support systems.

## Bayesian vs Frequentist
Bayesian methods incorporate prior beliefs and update them with data, while frequentist approaches focus on long-run frequencies.

## Conclusion
Probabilistic thinking enables robust predictions and rational decision-making in uncertain domains.
