# Blockchain Fundamentals

Covers decentralization, immutability, and transparency in distributed ledgers.

A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records called blocks that are used to record transactions across many computers. This distribution ensures that no single entity can alter the records without the consensus of the network.

- **Decentralization:** There is no central authority or single point of failure. The ledger is maintained by a network of participants.
- **Immutability:** Once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it is extremely difficult to alter. Each block is cryptographically linked to the one before it.
- **Transparency:** In public blockchains, anyone can view the transactions, although the identities of the participants are typically pseudonymous.
