# A Brief History of the Internet

Key milestones including 1971 email, 1983 DNS, and the 1991 World Wide Web.

The Internet began in the 1960s as a U.S. military project called ARPANET, designed to create a decentralized computer network that could withstand a nuclear attack. In the 1980s, the National Science Foundation created NSFNET, a network of supercomputer centers that became the backbone for the modern internet.

Key milestones include:
- **1971:** Email was invented by Ray Tomlinson.
- **1983:** The Domain Name System (DNS) was introduced, making addresses more user-friendly (e.g., `google.com` instead of an IP address).
- **1991:** Tim Berners-Lee released the World Wide Web, introducing URLs, HTTP, and HTML, making the internet accessible to the public.
