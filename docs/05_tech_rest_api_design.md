# Principles of REST API Design

Core REST principles, versioning strategies, structured error handling, and security best practices.

A well-designed REST API is predictable, evolvable, and easy to consume.

## Core Principles
- Resource Orientation
- Statelessness
- Standard Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Consistent Naming

## Versioning
Use URI or header-based versioning to manage breaking changes.

## Error Handling
Return structured error objects with machine-readable codes.

## Security
Apply least privilege, use HTTPS, and validate inputs rigorously.
