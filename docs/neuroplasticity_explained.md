# Understanding Neuroplasticity

 The brainâ€™s capacity to rewire for learning, memory, recovery; activities that enhance it.

Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. This phenomenon allows the neurons (nerve cells) in the brain to compensate for injury and disease and to adjust their activities in response to new situations or to changes in their environment.

This "brain malleability" is how we learn new skills, form memories, and recover from brain damage. Activities like learning a musical instrument, practicing mindfulness, and physical exercise can all promote positive neuroplastic changes.
