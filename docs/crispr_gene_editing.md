# CRISPR: A Revolution in Gene Editing

Outlines CRISPR-Cas9 components (Cas9, gRNA) and broad biomedical/agricultural applications

CRISPR-Cas9 is a revolutionary gene-editing technology that enables scientists to make precise changes to the DNA of living organisms. It is faster, cheaper, and more accurate than previous methods of DNA editing.

The system consists of two key components:
1.  **Cas9:** An enzyme that acts like a pair of "molecular scissors," capable of cutting strands of DNA.
2.  **Guide RNA (gRNA):** A small, customizable piece of RNA that guides the Cas9 enzyme to a specific sequence of DNA.

CRISPR has vast potential applications, from correcting genetic defects and treating diseases to improving crop resilience.
