# Principles of Sustainable Agriculture

Defines goals and practices like crop rotation, no-till farming, and IPM.

Sustainable agriculture is a method of farming that focuses on producing food in a way that can be maintained over the long term without degrading the environment. It integrates three main goals: environmental health, economic profitability, and social equity.

Key practices include:
- **Crop Rotation:** Planting different crops in succession to improve soil health and reduce pests.
- **No-Till Farming:** Planting crops without disturbing the soil through tillage to prevent erosion.
- **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Using a combination of methods to control pests, minimizing the reliance on chemical pesticides.
