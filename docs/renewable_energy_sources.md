# Sources of Renewable Energy

 Overview of solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass with brief descriptions.

Renewable energy is derived from natural sources that are replenished on a human timescale. The most common sources include solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass.

- **Solar Power:** Converts sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic (PV) panels or concentrating solar-thermal power systems. It is the most abundant energy resource on Earth.
- **Wind Power:** Uses wind turbines to capture kinetic energy from the wind and convert it into electricity. Wind farms can be located both onshore and offshore.
- **Hydropower:** Generates electricity by using the gravitational force of falling or flowing water to turn a turbine. It is one of the oldest and most established sources of renewable power.
