# Fundamentals of Distributed Systems

Key challenges, CAP theorem, and common patterns like leader election and quorum operations.

Distributed systems coordinate multiple computers to provide a unified service.

## Challenges
- Latency and Partial Failures
- Consensus
- Data Replication
- Network Partitions

## CAP Theorem
A system can only simultaneously provide two of Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance in the presence of failures.

## Patterns
- Leader Election
- Quorum Reads/Writes
- Eventual Consistency
