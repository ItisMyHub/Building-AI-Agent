- Chicken Breast: 600g (half of total; remainder for later lunches)
- Tofu: 1 block (press 15 min) (half of total; second block for stir-fry night)
- Brown Rice: 2 cups dry (≈ 400g) from 1kg bag
- Broccoli: 1 head (cut into florets) (second head for roasting another day)
- Mushrooms: 100g (half the pack; rest for stir-fry)
- Sweet Potatoes: 2 medium (cube) (1 left for roasting side)
- Black Beans: 1 can (rinsed) (2nd can for protein bowls later)
- Oranges: 1 (zest + juice for sauce) (3 left for snacks / breakfast)
- Almond Butter: 2 tbsp (dressing base)
- Eggs: 2 (soft‑boiled for topping) (10 remain for breakfasts)
- Cottage Cheese: (Optional) 4 tbsp as a high‑protein side scoop
- Pantry Additions: 1.5 tbsp olive oil (assumed staple), salt, pepper, chili flakes, minced garlic or powder, 1 tsp grated ginger (fresh or powder substitute)

### Citrus Ginger Dressing
Whisk: orange juice + zest, almond butter, 2 tbsp warm water, 1 tsp grated ginger, pinch salt, chili flakes to taste. Thin to pourable consistency.

### Directions
1. Cook brown rice (rinse; simmer 2 cups rice with 4 cups water + pinch salt ~35–40 min). Fluff and rest.
2. While rice cooks: cube sweet potatoes; toss with 1 tsp oil, salt, pepper. Roast at 200°C for 20–22 min (start mushrooms on same tray at minute 10).
3. Steam or roast broccoli florets lightly (tender‑crisp, ~6–7 min).
4. Soft‑boil eggs (6 min in simmering water; ice bath; peel carefully).
5. Press and cube tofu; sear in a nonstick pan with 1 tsp oil until golden; season with pinch salt & pepper. Remove.
6. In same pan, cook sliced chicken (light oil, med‑high heat) until internal temp 74°C; splash of orange juice at end to glaze.
7. Warm black beans briefly (rinse first) with a spoon of dressing to coat.
8. Assemble bowls: rice base, then sweet potato, broccoli, mushrooms, beans, chicken, tofu. Drizzle dressing. Halve eggs on top. Optional cottage cheese scoop on side.
9. Garnish with extra orange zest or chili flakes. Serve immediately.

### Leftover Utilisation
- Remaining chicken: slice for two lunch wraps or salads.
- Second tofu block: ginger garlic stir‑fry with remaining broccoli head + mushrooms.
- Extra black bean can: mash with spices for quick bean spread.
- Remaining oranges: breakfast fruit or fresh juice.
- Sweet potato (1): cube and roast for a side or blend into a protein smoothie.

### Nutritional Rationale (High-Level)
Combining lean chicken, tofu, beans, eggs, and cottage cheese options yields a diversified amino acid profile; almond butter & brown rice contribute sustained energy; citrus dressing adds vitamin C aiding iron absorption from plant sources.
