# Bioluminescence: Nature's Light

Explains bioluminescence purposes (mating, luring prey, defense) with examples like fireflies and anglerfish.


Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by a living organism. It is a form of chemiluminescence, where light energy is released by a chemical reaction. The most well-known example is the firefly, but this phenomenon occurs widely in marine vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as in some fungi and microorganisms.

Organisms use bioluminescence for various purposes, including:
- **Attracting Mates:** Fireflies use specific flash patterns to find partners.
- **Luring Prey:** The anglerfish uses a lighted lure to attract smaller fish in the deep sea.
- **Defense:** Some squid release a cloud of bioluminescent liquid to startle and distract predators.
