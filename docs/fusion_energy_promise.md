# The Promise of Fusion Energy

Describes fusion basics, abundant fuels, lower waste vs. fission, and remaining engineering hurdles

Fusion is the process that powers the sun and other stars. It involves forcing two lighter atomic nuclei to combine into a heavier nucleus, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. If harnessed on Earth, fusion could provide a virtually limitless source of clean, safe, and carbon-free energy.

The primary fuel for fusion—deuterium and lithium—is abundant in seawater and the Earth's crust. Unlike nuclear fission, fusion does not produce long-lived radioactive waste. While significant engineering challenges remain, projects like ITER are making steady progress toward achieving sustained fusion reactions.
